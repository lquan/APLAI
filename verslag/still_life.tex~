\subsection{Discussion}
\subsubsection{ECLiPSe}
The formulation of the problem is as explained in \cite{paper_still,paper_still2} almost a trivial exercise in constraint programming.
The main constraints of the problem are shown:
\begin{lstlisting}
% current cell and its neighbours	
Nbs #= ( Board[X-1,Y-1]  + Board[X,Y-1] + Board[X+1,Y-1] + 
	 Board[X-1,Y]    +  		  Board[X+1,Y]   + 
	 Board[X-1,Y+1]  + Board[X,Y+1] + Board[X+1,Y+1] ),

% live cell must be kept alive		 
Board[X,Y] => ( Nbs #>= 2 and Nbs #=<3 ),	 
% dead cell must stay dead
neg(Board[X,Y]) => Nbs #\= 3
\end{lstlisting}

The symmetry breaking in \cite{paper_still,paper_still2} can also be easily written.
Additionally, the coupling with external solvers for the linear programming allows to use a hybrid solver, which should perform considerably better.

\subsubsection{CHR}
We used the given starting program skeleton in CHR.
While the complete program is also very readable, the approach taken does require a complete different way of thinking. Also in general, the symmetry breaking constraints seem much more difficult to write, as is the coupling with an linear programming interface.



\subsubsection{JESS}
In essence, the same solution as for Sudoku could be used: Java for
input and ``guessing''/backtracking; and JESS would make use of rules to
propagate as much as possible. Many libraries exist for Java for optimization so a combination with a linear programming package would be possible, but the full integration with the rule handling would not be so trivial.

\subsubsection{Alternatives}
Maximum density still life has been studied intensively and various specialized optimizations have been proposed, e.g.~\cite{upperbound} and \cite{bdd}

\subsection{Viewpoints and programs}

\subsection{Experiments}
Experiments in ECLiPSe for MDSL were performed on the PC's of the computer labo's; for CHR again the same configuration as above.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
While CHR is not able to solve instances greater than $n=6$ under 15 minutes, ECLiPSe is. However, \ldots
